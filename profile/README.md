Hi everyone! I'm the solo creator behind **Shiba VRcade**, and I'm just starting out on an exciting adventure in the world of augmented reality (AR). My dream? To bring the cuteness of a Shiba Inu into your world through your phone!

Think of it like having a pet that you can carry in your pocket. You get to name your Shiba, play with it, teach it tricks, and just hang out. It's all the fun of a pet, without any mess! Whether you're chilling at home or out with friends, your virtual Shiba Inu<img src="https://github.com/Shiba-ARcade/.github/assets/95538451/898b2376-f7a0-406e-a6e4-3084118bd666" height="50px"/> is always ready to keep you company.

Right now, I'm at the beginning of this journey, learning the ropes of AR development. It's a big challenge, but hey, that's what makes it fun! I'm working hard to figure out how to turn this cool idea into a reality. 

I've got a demo video to give you a sneak peek of what I'm aiming for. It's just a small taste of what's to come â€“ think of it as a "hello" from your future virtual Shiba Inu buddy. This demo is my first step in creating an app where you can hang out with a super adorable Shiba Inu, play with it, and watch it do all sorts of cute things, right in your own space.

Keep in mind, this is just the start. There's a lot to learn and do, but I'm super excited to bring this idea to life. I'll be updating you all as I make progress, learn new things, and get closer to making our virtual Shiba Inu friends a reality.

So, join me on this journey at Shiba VRcade! Your support and enthusiasm mean the world to me as I take these first steps into the world of AR. Let's embark on this adventure together!

A little time and you can make your personal Shiba Inu happy!
